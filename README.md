# Image Compressor

This project was carried out during our second year at EPITECH in **Haskell**.

ðŸš€ The aim of this project was to develop an image compressor program based on the K-means algorithm, with the Haskell language.

## Launch the program
Launch the program simply lists the various clusters in the new compressed image.

To launch the program, follow these commands from the root directory of the repository:
```
make fclean
make
```
```
./imageCompressor -n [number_of_clusters] -l [convergence_limit] -f [source_image_pixels_list]
```
> **_NOTE_**: if the command `make fclean` return an error, it means that no cleaning was necessary.

## Launch the program with image generation
